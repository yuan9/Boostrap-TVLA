Updated bootstrapping: 
  - Changed order of dimensions to boot_set, range, point, all_boots
    where (range, point, all_boots) one numpy array.
    It allows better vectorization and simplifies postprocessing

10-11 Apr
Analyzed big dataset (1000 traces by (1000, 5000, 10000) points) for 4.5 sigmas?
  - Not a real difference, 50% error

Bootstrapping reconsideration
  Used for small datasets when no real representation exits
  Should be used like the data is not sufficient
  More boots for better distribution estimation with ks

Generated 500 traces, TP 5.5, FP 5.0, 12 + 12 points
TP and FP can be found as
TP GT 0.5: 8, LT 0.5: 4
FP GT 0.5: 4, LT 0.5: 8

Reconstructed small dataset for 4.5? sigmas to (400-600 operations)
  - sigmas decreased to 3.5, 4.0
  - Not a real difference

Started generating 5.5 sigma datasets
